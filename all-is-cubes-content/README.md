All is Cubes (content package)
==============================

All is Cubes is a “voxel game” where each block is made out of smaller blocks (one level of recursion).

This particular package is the procedural generation tools and demo content that I've created to test and demonstrate the functionality. It depends on [the core library crate `all-is-cubes`][all-is-cubes] and is depended by the application binaries, and exists as a separate crate for the sake of compilation speed and enforced modularity. See that crate's documentation for all questions of usage, stability, etc.
