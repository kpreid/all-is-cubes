//   • The face passed through to reach the current cube is reported.
//
// The foundation of this algorithm is a parameterized representation of
// the provided ray,
//                    origin + t * direction,
// except that t is not actually stored; rather, at any given point in the
// traversal, we keep track of the *greater* t values which we would have
// if we took a step sufficient to cross a cube boundary along that axis
// (i.e. change the integer part of the coordinate) in the components of
// t_max.
