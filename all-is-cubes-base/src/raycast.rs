///
/// * [`recursive_raycast()`] could produce more consistent/robust results if it could take more
///   information from the [`Raycaster`] than just what is put into [`RaycastStep`], and this would
///   lead to an alternate way of constructing [`Raycaster`] from [`Parameters`].
/// * [`RaycastStep::intersection_point()`] could be more convenient to use if it didn't need to
///   be given the original ray separately, and so we might end up with something that looks like
///   [`RaycastStep`] borrowing the [`Parameters`]. Might.
///
/// All of these things could in principle be done by storing more information in [`RaycastStep`],
/// but doing so could reduce performance when that information isn’t going to be used for the
/// current step; we’d be relying on the optimizer a lot to skip conditionally-unused calculations.
