All is Cubes
============

This project is (will be) a game engine for worlds made of cubical blocks. The unique feature of this engine is that each ordinary block is itself made out of blocks; each block can be directly edited in the same fashion as the outside world.

Or rather, that's the plan; for now, this is just my very first project written in Rust, and I am aiming to duplicate and expand on the functionality of my previous work [Cubes](https://github.com/kpreid/cubes/). That was written in JavaScript; this compiles to WebAssembly so the result will still run in the browser (hopefully faster), but also support a multiplayer server and storage backend.

Project organization and development
------------------------------------

This repository is divided into three Rust packages, split roughly according to different sets of dependencies:

* `all-is-cubes/` contains all of the fundamental data types and algorithms. It is intended to be usable as a library but also contains the non-platform-specific top-level application logic.
* `all-is-cubes-desktop/` is a standalone game app which will use [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) for platform windowing & graphics, or ASCII-art raytracing in the terminal.
* `all-is-cubes-wasm/` is the game app code for the browser/WebAssembly environment (if compiled outside of `wasm32` architecture, it will be empty). It is also a NPM package, which embeds the Rust code by way of `wasm-pack`. In order to use this, you must use either webpack-dev-server or the web server described next.
* `all-is-cubes-server/` is to be a network server for the game, but right now only contains a preconfigured HTTP static file server.

Because of the complication of having some wasm-specific code, some commands for building, testing, and running the entire project are collected in the `xtask` build tool for convenience and to ensure all non-Rust files are built when needed:

*   Run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

*   Build and lint all the code: `cargo xtask lint`

*   Development server: `cargo xtask run-dev`

    Note: the webpack-dev-server will automatically rebuild when files change *unless those files are outside of `all-is-cubes-wasm/`.*

*   Run the desktop/console game: `cargo run --bin all-is-cubes -- <options>`

*   Run the non-dev-mode game server: `cargo xtask run-game-server`

Stability and versioning
------------------------

All is Cubes is just getting started; many core features are not yet implemented, and implementing them will require incompatible changes. During development, library APIs change regularly, and the version numbering will mark these versions as incompatible (e.g. 0.3 to 0.4); there will be no 1.0 version until I am confident that future versions will at least have save data compatibility. However, I have made some attempt to mark API elements that are _more likely_ to change in future versions.

MSRV: The minimum supported Rust version is the current _stable_ version. This policy may change after a future 1.0 release.
