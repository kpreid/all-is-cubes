All is Cubes (UI package)
=========================

All is Cubes is a “voxel game” where each block is made out of smaller blocks (one level of recursion).

This particular library package contains the widget framework (which renders to voxels itself), and UI screens and abstractions for interactive applications.

The API is fairly unstable and primarily intended to serve the needs of the existing desktop and web “app” crates.
