/// Something that can participate in UI layout (via [`Layoutable`]), and then turn into
/// some interactive contents of a [`Space`] (via [`controller()`]) positioned according
/// to that layout.
///
/// This trait is object-safe so that collections (and in particular [`LayoutTree`]s) of
/// <code>[Arc]&lt;dyn Widget&gt;</code> can be used.
///
/// # Mutability and dependence
///
/// A widget may be instantiated in multiple [`Space`]s by calling [`controller()`] more
/// than once. All such instances should operate independently (not interfering with each
/// other) and equivalently.
///
/// A widget may reference changing data (e.g. the current value of some setting).
/// However, a widget should not behave differently in response to such data, as the
/// systems which manage widgets do not track such changes.
/// In particular, the widget's implementation of [`Layoutable`] should always give the
/// same answer, and the [`WidgetController`] it produces should be equivalent to instances
/// created at other times.
/// Instead, the [`WidgetController`], once created, is responsible for updating the
/// particular piece of [`Space`] granted to the widget whenever the input data changes
/// or the widget is interacted with.
///
/// # Where to find widgets
///
/// Standard widgets may be found in the [`vui::widgets`](crate::vui::widgets) module.
///
/// [`LayoutTree`]: crate::vui::LayoutTree
/// [`controller()`]: Self::controller
pub trait Widget: Layoutable + Debug + Send + Sync {
    /// Create a [`WidgetController`] to manage the widget's existence in a particular
    /// region of a particular [`Space`].
    ///
    /// The difference between a [`Widget`] and its [`WidgetController`]s is that each
    /// [`WidgetController`] must *separately* keep track of which changes need to be
    /// performed within its associated [`Space`]; the [`Widget`] may be instantiated in
    /// any number of [`Space`]s but does not need to keep track of them all. It is
    /// common for a [`WidgetController`] to hold an [`Arc`] pointer to its [`Widget`] to
    /// make use of information from its original definition.
    ///
    /// You should not usually need to call this method, but rather use
    /// [`WidgetTree::installation()`](crate::vui::LayoutTree::installation) to create
    /// controllers and attach them to a [`Space`]. However, it is valid for a widget to
    /// reuse another widget's controller implementation.

/// implementations, though there are common utilities such as [`OneshotController`].
///
/// Currently, [`WidgetController`]s are expected to manage their state and todo by being
