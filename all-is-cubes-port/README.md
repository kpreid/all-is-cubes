All is Cubes Import/Export
==========================

All is Cubes is a “voxel game” where each block is made out of smaller blocks (one level of recursion).

This particular package provides routines for data import and export between All is Cubes’ types and other data formats. It depends on [the core library crate `all-is-cubes`][all-is-cubes]. Currently supported formats:

* All is Cubes native JSON data files
* MagicaVoxel `.vox` voxel scene files
* [glTF 2.0] (export only)
* [STL] (export only)

[glTF 2.0]: https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html
[all-is-cubes]: https://crates.io/crates/all-is-cubes
[STL]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)>
