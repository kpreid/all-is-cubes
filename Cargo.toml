  # Including this makes the fuzz targets automatically built so we know they aren't broken.
  # But, `cargo test` sometimes ignores `[[bin]] test = false` directives,
  #     https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8338
  # so doing this causes test failures in thise circumstances.
  # As a substitute, I've included explicitly building the fuzz targets in the `xtask` build process.
