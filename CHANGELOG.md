## 0.4.0 (2022-01-29)

### Added

- Functionality:
    - New universe template, "dungeon", generating an enclosed maze of rooms. I hope to build on this further to create some sort of gameplay (e.g. finding keys to unlock doors) and a tutorial for All is Cubes' functionality from a player's perspective; currently, all the rooms are the same.
    - New universe template, "menger-sponge". Fractals are cool.
    - There is now some amount of clickable user interface: pause and mouselook functions are visible as clickable buttons. Soon we may have actual menu screens!

- Graphics:
    - The software raytracer now implements volumetric transparency; blocks whose colors have alpha between 0 and 1 may be rendered as a solid volume of translucent material, rather than the alpha being applied at the surface, if the graphics options request it. However, the light model does not yet have a reasonable interpretation of how to light these volumes, so blocks may have unreasonably dark parts. I hope that future work will address this and also better handling of material surfaces (e.g. light reflections at the surface of glass, vs the lack of them in fog or at the meeting surfaces of adjacent similar blocks).

- `all-is-cubes` library:
    - New major items:
        - `apps::StandardCameras` manages the `Camera`s needed for rendering, given the necessary inputs. It is intended to reduce duplicated code and coupling in each renderer.
        - `universe::VisitRefs` trait allows traversing the `URef` graph inside a `Universe`.
        - `util::YieldProgress` is an interface for long-running async tasks to report their progress.
    - New features in existing types:
        - `Aab::center()` returns the center point of the box.
        - `BehaviorSet::query()` for looking up existing behaviors.
        - `BehaviorSetTransaction::insert()` for adding a behavior via transaction.
        - `BlockAttributes::rotation_rule` and `RotationPlacementRule` define how a block should be automatically rotated when placed.
        - `Camera::exposure` for controlling displayed brightness. Both renderers implement it. Nothing sets it yet.
        - `Camera::post_process_color()` applies the new exposure and tone-mapping settings to a color value.
        - `Evoxel::from_block()` for performing the same conversion from a full block to a voxel that `Block::Recur(...).evaluate()` does.
        - `Face::dot()`, for dot product with a vector without constructing an intermediate unit vector.
        - `GraphicsOptions::tone_mapping` and `ToneMappingOperator` (not yet providing good operators, just the mechanisms to have the feature at all).
        - `Rgb::from_srgb8()`.
        - `Rgb::luminance()` and `Rgba::luminance()`.
        - `SpaceMesh` now remembers the `TextureAllocator::Tile`s it was constructed using, just like `BlockMesh` does, so callers no longer need to do so.
        - `SpaceMesh::blocks_used_iter()` reports which block indices went into the mesh.
        - `SpaceTransaction::set()`, for faster construction of large transactions instead of many small ones. (This will likely be changed further to have better naming and convenience.)
        - `SpaceTransaction::nonconserved()` requests that merging two transactions with the same effect on some cube should not be considered a conflict.
        - `math::cube_to_midpoint()` function for the pattern of converting to float and adding 0.5.
    - The following functions are now `const fn`:
        - `Grid::for_block()`
        - `Rgb::from_srgb8()`
        - `Rgba::from_srgb8()`

- `all-is-cubes-content` library:
    - `UniverseTemplate::build` is now an async function, which accepts a `YieldProgress` hook parameter. This means that there can be progress bars (currently implemented in desktop but not web) and that building doesn't hang the web event loop.

- `all-is-cubes-desktop`:
    - Can now “open data files”. Currently the only file format supported is MagicaVoxel `.vox` scene files; when we have a native file format that will be supported too. Files can be opened by passing them on the command line or by dropping them on an open window.
    - Terminal mode now has mouse support for placing and removing blocks.
    - Terminal mode no longer goes blank if asked to use graphic characters but not colors.

### Changed

- Game mechanics:
    - `Character`s no longer inherently have the ability to fly; they can only do so if they have a `Tool::Jetpack` in their inventory.
    - It is no longer possible to jump multiple times in the same frame.

- Graphics:
    - Fixed a bug in the GPU renderer where dark areas would always have a noticeable minimum brightness (`PackedLight` did not have the same interpretation in the Rust and GLSL code for a value of zero).
    - Block meshes are no longer computed all at once, reducing maximum frame time during startup (or, in the future, when moving from viewing one `Space` to another).
    - Optimized construction and depth-sorting of meshes for transparent blocks. They still don't draw correctly, but they are less slow.
    - Various performance improvements to the raytracer.

- `all_is_cubes` library:
    - The new minimum supported Rust version is 1.56.0 (2021 edition).
    - Breaking: The items previously in `all_is_cubes::lum` are now in a separate crate `all_is_cubes_gpu`, and the `"lum"` feature no longer exists.
    - Breaking: The `triangulator` module has been renamed to `mesh`. All types with `Triangulation` in the name now use `Mesh` instead.
        - `BlockTriangulation` → `BlockMesh`
        - `BlockTriangulations` → `BlockMeshes`
        - `SpaceTriangulation` → `SpaceMesh`
            - `SpaceMesh` takes an additional type parameter for the texture type.
        - `BlockTriangulationProvider` → `BlockMeshProvider`
        - `TriangulatorOptions` → `MeshOptions`
    - Breaking: The raytracer is now more flexible and allows custom data to pass into the tracing process.
        - Instead of `PixelBuf` having a single output type, the raytracer returns the `PixelBuf` and lets the caller convert it (or provide a conversion function, for `trace_scene_to_image` which returns a slice of converted values).
        - Block data is computed via a separate trait, `RtBlockData`, and has access to `GraphicsOptions` and an arbitrary extra parameter. Multiple types of `PixelBuf` may be used with the same `SpaceRaytracer` as long as they agree on a concrete type of `RtBlockData`.

    - Breaking: The color values written into `all_is_cubes::mesh::TextureTile` are now in sRGB; previously, they were linear.
    - Breaking: `GLRenderer::new()` now expects a `StandardCameras` (instead of the components of one).
    - Breaking: `AllIsCubesAppState::update_cursor()` now expects a `&StandardCameras` instead of two `Camera`s.
    - Breaking: `Camera::set_view_matrix()` is now `Camera::set_view_transform()`, and expects a `cgmath::Decomposed` transform, inverted from the matrix version.
    - Breaking: `Space::spawn_mut()` replaced by `Space::set_spawn()`.
    - The `Name` enum is now intended to be reliably cheap to clone:
        - `Name::Specific`'s field holds an `Arc<str>` instead of a `String`. 
        - `Universe`-related errors now hold `Name` instead of `Arc<Name>`.
    - Renamed: `Evoxel::new()` to `Evoxel::from_color()`.
    - Renamed: `apps::Tick` is now `time::Tick`. 
    - Renamed: `Rgba::from_srgb_32bit()` is now `Rgba::from_srgb8()`, and `Rgba::to_srgb_32bit()` is now `Rgba::to_srgb8()`. This is more consistent with what I understand to be common terminology (specifying the component size instead of the total size), and allows the same name to be used sensibly for `Rgb`.

## 0.3.0 (2021-10-09)

### Added

- Demo content: Multiple scenes are now available, through the command-line option `--template`, web page URL parameter `?template=`, or in code as `all_is_cubes_content::UniverseTemplate`. The available templates include:
    - `demo-city`: The default in the previous version: a collection of many examples of specific functionality. (Now with more stuff, of course.)
    - `atrium`: A voxel interpretation of the Sponza Atrium rendering test scene (from scratch, not a data conversion).
    - `blank`: No data at all. Mostly useless except for testing.
    - `cornell-box`: A version of the [Cornell box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box) rendering test scene.

- `all-is-cubes-desktop`:
    - New graphics mode `-g record` for rendering images or video (currently only in PNG or APNG format).
    - New option `--display-size` to choose the window or image size.
    - New option `--precompute-light` to fully compute `Space` light before displaying anything.
    - Terminal mode (`-g terminal`):
        - Pipelined simulation and rendering for more CPU utilization.
        - Keyboard controls over the text and color modes used.
        - Double-resolution mode using “▄” graphic characters.
        - UI has more HUD elements.
        - Implemented using the `crossterm` library instead of `termion`, and should therefore support Windows (not tested).
    - Reads graphics options from `graphics.json` in whatever [directories-next](https://docs.rs/directories-next/2.0.0/directories_next/) thinks is a platform-appropriate app configuration directory.
    - Added info text overlay like the web version.

- Graphics:
    - Color values produced in all modes are now sRGB instead of linear, which should be more correct on most displays.
    - Various graphics options are now configurable without recompiling, through the `GraphicsOptions` type.
    - “Smooth lighting”, interpolated across block faces.
    - Triangulator and  `all-is-cubes::lum` (GPU triangle-based renderer):
        - Blocks with resolution greater than 16 are now drawn with correct shapes, though not textures unless they have solid-colored faces because the texture allocator is still limited.
        - Added frustum culling.
        - Added distance fog.
        - Now supports transparent blocks, as the raytracer already did. This support is complete for `Block::Atom` blocks but poor to nonexistent for `Block::Recur` blocks.
        - Light changes no longer require rebuilding chunk triangulations.
    - Fixed several bugs in light calculation, including one that could lead to runaway brightness.

- Physics and game mechanics:
    - Character now has limited reach (can no longer interact with arbitrarily distant blocks).
    - Gravity is now a property of individual `Space`s.
    - Characters collide against the voxel shapes of blocks, not just their unit cube bounds. This happens only if the block's `BlockCollision` attribute is `Recur`.
    - Inventory items are now stackable, and “finite rather than infinite” block items exist — you can place a block in a `Space` and lose it from your inventory, or the reverse.

- User interface:
    - Mouselook support.
    - Cursor markers no longer lag behind the camera.
    - The HUD now displays a “tooltip” with the name of the selected tool/block.

- `all_is_cubes` library API:
    - `Universe`, `URef`, `Space`, `Listener`, and so on now implement `Send` and `Sync`. They are not fully equipped for useful multithreaded operation (in particular, there is are no principles for deadlock-free lock acquisition of various `URef`s), but it is now possible to, for example, construct a `Universe` on one thread and send it to another.
    - Transactions (`all_is_cubes::transaction`). Transactions describe modifications to a game object or many within the same `Universe`. They enable:
        - Ensuring that a set of modifications is committed or entirely rejected (preventing “item duplication” kinds of bugs).
        - Deferring mutations to solve borrowing problems.
        - For example, `Tool`s' modifications of `Space`s are now exclusively performed as transactions.
    - Behaviors (`all_is_cubes::behavior`). The `Behavior` trait can be implemented to add custom behavior to a `Space` or `Character` (a sort of “scripting”). Its functionality is very limited for now and may be substantially revised.
    - Inventories and items (`all_is_cubes::inv`) are now public.
    - `Aab` implements `From<Grid>`.
    - `Aab::contains()`
    - `Aab::face_coordinate()`: returns one of the box's six coordinates.
    - `Aab::random_point()`
    - `Aab::round_up_to_grid()`
    - `Aab::scale()`
    - `Block::rotate()`: generates a canonical `Block::Rotated` version of a block.
    - `Block::unspecialize()` to undo rotation and, in the future, other changes that are considered specific to a block's particular placement in a `Space` (such as being due to interactions with other blocks).
    - `BlockAttributes::animation_hint`
    - `Face` implements `TryFrom<GridVector>`.
    - `FaceMap::iter()`
    - `FaceMap::repeat()`
    - `GenError` and `InGenError` types for classifying worldgen failures.
    - `Grid::checked_new()`: returns an error instead of panicking.
    - `Grid::abut()`: constructs a grid adjacent to an existing one (useful for making walls).
    - `Grid::axis_range()`: as `x_range()`, `y_range()`, `z_range()` but with a parameter for the axis.
    - `Grid::expand()`: enlarges a grid by moving its faces.
    - `Grid::intersection()`
    - `Grid::unsigned_size()`
    - `GridArray` implements `IndexMut`.
    - `GridArray::from_elements()`
    - `GridArray::map()`
    - `GridMatrix::decompose()` to decompose into a translation and rotation.
    - `GridMatrix::inverse_transform()`
    - `GridMatrix::transform_cube()`
    - `GridRotation::{ALL, IDENTITY, CLOCKWISE, COUNTERCLOCKWISE}`
    - `GridRotation::from_to()` (a “look at” operation of sorts)
    - `GridRotation::inverse()`
    - `GridRotation::is_reflection()`
    - `GridRotation::iterate()` to repeat a rotation exactly until it loops to the start.
    - `GridRotation::to_rotation_matrix()`
    - `Rgb::clamp()`, `Rgba::clamp()`
    - `Space::builder()`: returns `SpaceBuilder` for configuring a new space's properties.
    - `Space::evaluate_light()` and `Space::fast_evaluate_light()` can be used for immediate light evaluation.
    - `Space::fill_uniform()`: faster than `Space::fill()` when filling with only one block.
    - `SpaceRaytracer::trace_scene_to_image()` can be used to produce an RGBA image.
    - `TextureAllocator`, the trait through which the triangulator outputs textures, is now expected to offer 3D textures instead of 2D. This significantly reduces the number of redundant texels for complex blocks (at the cost of more never-seen texels for simple blocks).

- Some information is logged using the `log` crate (startup progress and some nonfatal errors).

### Changed

- `all_is_cubes` library:
    - No longer depends on the `luminance-front` crate.

    - Expansions:
        - `Space` can now store up to `u16::MAX` (65536) distinct blocks, instead of 256.
        - `Grid` now allows zero-volume grids.

    - Breaking parameter/field/type changes:
        - `draw_to_blocks()` now takes options for Z dimensions and the attributes of the resulting blocks.
        - `GridRotation` is now an enum, so its size is 1 byte and it cannot have invalid values.
        - `EvaluatedBlock` now has an explicit `.resolution` field. The dimensions of the `.voxels` field no longer implicitly define the resolution; if `.voxels` is smaller than the block then the missing voxels should be treated as `AIR`.
        - The API of `all_is_cubes::triangulator` has been substantially revised to support depth sorting and separation of transparent triangles, and to remove unnecessary complexity.
        - New type `GraphicsOptions` stores global user-settable rendering options, and is required by most graphics-related functions.
        - `make_some_blocks()` returns an array rather than a vector, taking the size as a const generic parameter.
        - `Universe::get_default_character()` returns `Option` instead of panicking.
        - `Face::axis_number()` returns `Option` instead of panicking.
        - `all_is_cubes::listen::Sink` now stores messages in order without duplicates, and offers the method `.drain()` instead of implementing `Iterator`.
    
    - Breaking: The integration with `embedded_graphics` now uses API version 0.7. The drawing target type has been renamed from `VoxelDisplayAdapter` to `DrawingPlane`.
    - Breaking: `all_is_cubes::util::ConciseDebug` is now generalized as `all_is_cubes::util::CustomFormat` which takes one of several formatting types.

    - Renamed: The modules `all_is_cubes::blockgen`, `all_is_cubes::worldgen`, and `all_is_cubes::content` have all been replaced by the separate crate `all_is_cubes_content`.
    - Renamed: `all_is_cubes::camera::Camera` to `all_is_cubes::character::Character`, and `all_is_cubes::camera::ProjectionHelper` to `Camera`.
    - Renamed: `all_is_cubes::camera::InputProcessor` to `all_is_cubes::apps::InputProcessor`.
    - Renamed: `all_is_cubes::lum::glrender::Viewport` to `all_is_cubes::camera::Viewport`.
    - Renamed: `all_is_cubes::universe::FrameClock` to `all_is_cubes::apps::FrameClock`.
    - Renamed: `GridArray::generate()` and `FaceMap::generate()` to `from_fn()`.
    - Renamed: `Aab::expand()` to `Aab::enlarge()`
    
    - `Grid::index()` no longer overflows on some out of range coordinates.
    - `Raycaster` will stop iteration rather than overflowing if the ray exits the range of possible cube coordinates (`i32`).

- Development tools:
    - The project's custom build scripts are now provided using the [cargo xtask pattern](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask) rather than a Makefile. This means that the `make` tool is not needed, and instead of e.g. `make run-dev`, you would now write `cargo xtask run-dev`.

### Removed

- Most of `all_is_cubes::lum` is no longer public as I have decided those items should be considered implementation details. The top-level struct `GLRenderer` (which needs a better name) is no longer in the `glrender` submodule.
- `FaceMap::values()`: use `FaceMap::iter()` instead.
- `Universe::get_default_space()`

## 0.2.1 (2021-01-18)

A changelog was not kept for this and earlier releases.
