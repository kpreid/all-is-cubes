All is Cubes
============

A “voxel game” engine where each block is made out of smaller blocks (one level of recursion).

This is a work in progress; it's my very first project written in Rust, and I am aiming to duplicate and expand on my previous work [Cubes](https://github.com/kpreid/cubes/). Currently implemented:

* Core data model of [Blocks] and [Spaces] (subject to change).
* Rendering using a CPU-only raytracer. (See `all-is-cubes-gpu` for GPU.)
* 2D drawing into the voxel space, built on top of the [embedded-graphics] library.

For more information on the capabilities, limitations, and requirements of the library,
please consult [the crate documentation].

This library is intended to be somewhat reusable for working with block/voxel data, but it does not currently have a particularly stable interface as I am still changing it as requirements are discovered.

“The game” is in quotes because all you can do for the moment is place and remove blocks and look at the scenery.

Stability and versioning
------------------------

All is Cubes is an ambitious hobby project; many features necessary to be “complete” are not yet implemented, and implementing them will require incompatible changes. During development, library APIs change regularly, and the version numbering will mark these versions as incompatible (e.g. 0.3 to 0.4); there will be no 1.0 version until I am confident that future versions will at least have save data compatibility. However, I have made some attempt to document API elements that are _more likely_ to change in future versions.

MSRV policy: The current release accurately documents its `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`.
Future releases will typically require the current stable Rust version as of that release.
