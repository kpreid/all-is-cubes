/// A mutation that is to be performed atomically.

/// A `Transaction` is a description of a mutation to an object or collection thereof that
/// should occur in a logically atomic fashion (all or nothing), with a set of
/// preconditions for it to happen at all. (Here we mean [“atomic” in the database sense][atomic],
/// not in the CPU instruction sense.)
///
/// Transactions are used:
///
/// * to enable game objects to have effects on their containers in a way compatible
///   with Rust's ownership rules,
/// * to avoid bugs of the “item duplication” sort, by checking all preconditions before making
///   any changes, and
/// * to avoid update-order-dependent game mechanics by applying effects in batches.
///
/// A [`Transaction`] is not consumed by committing it; it may be used repeatedly. Future
/// work may include building on this to provide undo/redo functionality.
///
/// If a transaction implements [`Default`], then the default value should be a
/// transaction which has no effects and always succeeds, and is cheap to create.
