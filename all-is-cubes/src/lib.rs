//! All is Cubes is a game/engine for worlds made of cubical blocks, where the blocks
//! are themselves made of “smaller” blocks (voxels) that define their appearance and
//! behavior.
//!
//! This crate defines the world model, simulation rules, and basic non-GPU-accelerated
//! rendering.
//! (User interface components, platform glue, and game content are kept in other crates.)
//! This crate is designed to be a reusable library for simulating and rendering voxel
//! world/scenes, but is not yet mature.
//!
//! ## Capabilities
//!
//! Here is a brief summary of the concepts and capabilities (actual or planned) of
//! All is Cubes, so that you may evaluate whether it suits your needs. Many of these
//! details are subject to change; this is currently a one-author project with a rather
//! chaotic vision.
//!
//! ### Data model
//!
//! Note that there is not currently any networking/multiplayer, or any save files.
//! Both of these are planned, but may result in substantal revisions to the data model.
//!
//! * [`Universe`] manages a graph of interrelated game objects. It is intended to
//!   be the run-time form of what a player might call “a save file” or “a world”.
//!   Time advances at a uniform rate throughout a `Universe`.
//! * A [`Space`] is a 3D array of [`Block`]s forming the physical space/scene which
//!   player characters can move through and interact with.
//!     * `Space`s currently have fixed boundaries (no infinite procedural generation),
//!       can have dimensions in the range of an [`i32`], and are kept in memory
//!       uncompressed at 6 bytes per cube. They can contain at most 65536 distinct
//!       blocks (subject to change).
//!     * The light falling on surfaces within a `Space` is computed using a global
//!       illumination algorithm (optionally).
//!     * In addition to their [`Block`] contents, `Space`s have global physical
//!       properties such as gravity and illumination. They also can have [`Behavior`]s
//!       attached for miscellaneous “scripting” purposes, though this feature is
//!       incomplete.
//!     * There can be arbitrarily many spaces per [`Universe`]. Eventually there will
//!       be ways to teleport between spaces; for now, this mainly assists [`Block`]s.
//! * A [`Block`] is a cubical object which can be placed in a [`Space`] or carried in
//!   a [`Character`]'s inventory.
//!     * Blocks' shape and appearance (their [`Primitive`]) is either a cube of a single
//!        color, or recursively defined by a [`Space`] of smaller blocks (at a reduced
//!        size between 1/2 to 1/255 of a full cube).
//!        Each of these voxels can be transparent.
//!         * The player will be able to enter these [`Space`]s and interactively edit
//!           blocks. This is not currently implemented but that is a lack in the user
//!           interface rather than core data structures.
//!         * In the future, there may be ways for blocks to be fully procedurally defined
//!           rather than working through [`Space`]s, such as for the purposes of
//!           animation or deriving variations from a single template or formula.
//!     * Blocks can have [`Modifier`]s applied to them which change the basic shape and
//!       behavior in a particular instance, such as being rotated into different
//!       orientations.
//!     * Blocks will have various forms of active behavior and responses to their
//!       environment but that has not been designed yet.
//! * A [`Character`] can move around a [`Space`], acting as the player's viewpoint, and
//!   carry [`Tool`]s (items) with which to affect the space.
//!     * There can be multiple characters, but not yet any multiplayer, NPC AI, or even
//!       being able to see another character. Some of these this may be in the future.
//!     * A character's ability to modify the [`Space`] depends entirely on the provided
//!       tools, so that there can be entirely free editing or only actions following
//!       gameplay rules.
//!
//! ### Coordinate system
//!
//! Currently, there are some assumptions of a specific coordinate system.
//! All of these might be generalized in the future.
//!
//! * [`Space`] and [`Block`] use 3-dimensional integer coordinates with no assumptions
//!   about axes. However, the default [`SpacePhysics`] configuration currently has a
//!   gravity vector in the &minus;Y direction.
//! * [`camera`] assumes OpenGL-style coordinates: +X right, +Y up, +Z towards viewer —
//!   a “right-handed” coordinate system.
//! * [`Character`] and [`Body`] have a look direction and corresponding transformation
//!   matrix which use the same coordinate system as [`camera`].
//!   Jumping is also hardcoded to work in the +Y direction.
//!   Future versions may support arbitrary character orientation.
//!
//! ## Crate features
//!
//! This crate, `all_is_cubes`, defines the following feature flags:
//!
//! * `save`:
//!   Enable [`serde`] serialization of [`Universe`]s and some other types.
//! * `threads`:
//!   Enable use of threads for parallel and background processing, including via
//!   [`rayon`]’s global thread pool.
//!   This feature does not affect the public API, only performance and dependencies.
//! * `arbitrary`: Adds implementations of the [`arbitrary::Arbitrary`] trait for
//!   fuzzing / property testing on types defined by this crate.
//!
//! ## Platform compatibility
//!
//! * This crate is not `no_std` compatible due to need for floating-point functions,
//!   and several currently incompatible dependencies.
//! * However, it is compatible with web `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
//!   That is, the parts of `std` it uses are the thread-safety and floating-point parts,
//!   not IO (and not creating threads, unless requested).
//! * `usize` must be at least 32 bits (that is, not 16).
//!
//! ## Dependencies and global state
//!
//! `all_is_cubes` avoids having any global state, for the most part. However, it does write
//! log messages using the [`log`] crate and is therefore subject to that global
//! configuration.
//!
//! `all_is_cubes` depends on and re-exports the following crates as part of its public
//! API:
//!
//! * [`cgmath`] for vector math (as `all_is_cubes::cgmath`).
//!   This design choice was not made after a thorough review and I am open to being
//!   convinced to switching libraries. (The replacement must accept arbitrary types for
//!   vector components.)
//! * [`ordered_float`] (as `all_is_cubes::math::NotNan`).
//! * [`embedded_graphics`] (as `all_is_cubes::drawing::embedded_graphics`).
