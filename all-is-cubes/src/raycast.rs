//! Algorithm for raycasting through voxel grids.
//!
//! This deals purely with the question “which cubes does this ray intersect”,
//! and does not concern itself with what might occupy those cubes. If you’re
//! looking for *raytracing*, forming an image from many rays, that’s
//! `all_is_cubes_render::raytracer`.
