//! `unsafe` code to manage access to pending universe members.
//!
//! This is a narrowly restricted “self-referential struct” implementation; specifically, it is
//! an “owner and borrower” pair of the sort which `yoke` and `self_cell` support.
//! I am not using these libraries because:
//!
//! * `yoke` does not permit `&mut T` access to the borrower except by `'static`
//!   functions. This is intended to prevent the hazard of inserting a too-short reference
//!   into the `T` structure. In our case, this is not a problem because the `T` we expose
//!   via [`DerefMut`] is the `T` inside the [`RwLock`], not the [`RwLockWriteGuard`]
//!   that has the lifetime. It's also `'static`, but I don't think that is actually
//!   necessary.
//!
//! * `self_cell` (and `ouroboros ~0.16.0`) do not support type parameters.
//!   Our usage of type parameters is not strictly necessary — it is a finite set of
//!   universe member types — so it would be _possible_ to use them anyway.
//!
//! * `self_cell` and `ouroboros` both have to heap-allocate the owning field(s) in order
//!   to keep them unmoving. We can skip that since our owner is an `Arc` already.
//!
//! Further discussion of this code:
//! <https://users.rust-lang.org/t/unsafe-code-review-semi-owning-weak-rwlock-t-guard/95706>
//!
//! TODO(ecs): Revisit whether we really need this, after the ECS migration.
