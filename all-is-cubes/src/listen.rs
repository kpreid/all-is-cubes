//! Broadcasting of notifications of state changes, and other messages.
//!
//! Objects which wish to send notifications use [`Notifier`]s, which manage a collection
//! of [`Listener`]s. Each listener reports when it is no longer needed and may be
//! discarded.
//!
//! When [`Notifier::notify`] is called to send a message, it is synchronously delivered
//! to all listeners; therefore, listeners are obligated to avoid making further
//! significant state changes. The typical pattern is for a listener to contain a
//! `Weak<Mutex<...>>` or similar multiply-owned mutable structure to aggregate incoming
//! messages, which will then be read and cleared by a later task.

    /// used by the `Listener` and its destination, as that could result in deadlock.

    /// then be read and cleared by a later task; see [`FnListener`] for assistance in
    /// implementing this pattern.
    ///
    /// Note that a [`Notifier`] might call `.receive(&[])` at any time, particularly when
