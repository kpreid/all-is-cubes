All is Cubes (GPU rendering package)
====================================

All is Cubes is a “voxel game” where each block is made out of smaller blocks (one level of recursion).

This particular library package contains algorithms for rendering All is Cubes content using the [`wgpu`] graphics API abstraction library.

The API is fairly unstable and primarily intended to serve the needs of the existing desktop and web “app” crates; I do not recommend using this library directly. If you have a use case for this library, please get in touch.
