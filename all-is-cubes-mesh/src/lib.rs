//! Data structures and algorithms for converting [`all_is_cubes`] voxel data to triangle
//! meshes for rendering or export.
//!
//! All of the algorithms here are independent of graphics API, but they require providing
//! vertex and texture data types suitable for the API or data format you wish to use.
//!
//! Restrictions and caveats:
//! * The algorithms always generate triangles with counterclockwise winding order.
//! * The generated meshes are designed for rendering and not for purposes which require
//!   “watertight” meshes such as 3D printing systems.
//! * The generated meshes are in the “blocky” style (have the appearance of being made of
//!   axis-aligned cubes) rather than attempting to present a smooth surface (as would be
//!   produced by, for example, the marching cubes algorithm); this is consistent with the
//!   approach used by [`all_is_cubes`] as a whole.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! [`BlockMesh`] and [`SpaceMesh`] are the key types; everything else supports their
//! creation and usage. For real-time dynamically modified meshes, use
//! [`dynamic::ChunkedSpaceMesh`].
//!
//! To support a new API/format, you will need to create suitable implementations of the
//! [`Vertex`] and [`texture::Allocator`] traits, then implement [`MeshTypes`] to bundle them
//! together.
