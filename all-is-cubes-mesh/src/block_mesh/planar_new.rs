//! Algorithm for taking arbitrary orthogonal polygons that form the surfaces of voxel shapes
//! and triangulating them.
//!
//! This is a [sweep line algorithm] which processes vertices in the order which [`super::analyze`]
//! provides them. It does not introduce any additional vertices, which ensures that the resulting
//! mesh will not contain any “T-junctions” (places where a triangle edge meets a vertex rather than
//! another edge).
//!
//! # Background and alternatives
//!
//! Many voxel games use the so-called “greedy meshing” algorithm. This algorithm is fast and
//! efficient in number of triangles created; however, it creates T-junctions, which lead to
//! random single-pixel gaps in the rendered mesh. All is Cubes is designed to favor correctness.
//!
//! Still, there are other ways we could solve this problem:
//!
//! * We could take greedy meshing’s output of quads (not yet converted to triangles), then find
//!   each T-junction between these quads’ edges and corners, and mark it as a place to introduce
//!   an extra vertex on all quads touching that point (triangulating each quad as a simple convex
//!   polygon). This produces extra vertices, and requires comparing all the quads to each other
//!   to find the junctions.
//!
//! * We could use an existing polygon triangulation library.
//!   This has not been done because
//!
//!   * algorithms not designed exclusively for [orthogonal polygons] would require us
//!     to preprocess the vertices into separate loops and identify holes, and might do more
//!     work than necessary to handle diagonal lines that won’t ever occur;
//!   * with an internal algorithm we can tweak it for performance based on benchmarks of our
//!     own situation;
//!   * and writing a new algorithm was more fun;
//!
//!   but this option is still worth further investigation.
//!   Searching for libraries that currently exist on crates.io which
//!   claim to triangulate polygons with holes turned up [`earcut`](https://crates.io/crates/earcut)
//!   which looks promising. Other libraries which looked less promising include:
//!
//!   * [`earcutr`](https://crates.io/crates/earcutr) — another port of the same algorithm as
//!     `earcut`, but is not `no_std` and does not allow avoiding reallocations
//!   * [`i_triangle`](https://crates.io/crates/i_triangle) — large API with little documentation
//!   * [`poly2tri-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/poly2tri-rs) — not `no_std` (includes things like
//!     file loading functions), not efficient in allocations, little documentation
//!   * [`triangulate`](https://crates.io/crates/triangulate) — heavy deps (rand, backtrace)
